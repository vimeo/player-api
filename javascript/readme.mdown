Hi everyone!

Included is our JavaScript library for using the API with our Universal Embed code.
We suggest that you either host the JS file yourself, or link to our official hosted copy:

For more information on the JS API, see [our player documentation page](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api).

Until we meet again!
